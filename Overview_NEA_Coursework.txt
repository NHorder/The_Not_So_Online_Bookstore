Overview Guide for AQA Computer Science NEA Coursework: Name: Nathan Horder  Candidate ID: 0183

Python Libraries Used:

   import random - Used to randomly select integers, this is used primearily for the "Random" genre button

   import tkinter - This library is used to create the UI interface that the user interacts with, this also creates the widgets (Buttons, Labels, Text boxes, entry boxes,ect)

   from PIL import ImageTk,Image - The library PIL is used to import "ImageTk" and "Image". These two imports are used to display the images that is used throughout the software, this is a vital import and is required to run the program

   from functools import partial - The library functools in used to import "partial", this allows the button used from the tkinter library to call the same subroutine but with a value dependent on the button selected. This is mainly
   used to make the program more effient

   from shutil import copyfile - The library shutil is used to import "copyfile", this allows a file to be copied from the user's files onto the USB, this is used when the user wants to change their profile picture. This prevents the
   error of unique account images from creating errors when the USB is used on other devices



Databases Used:

    Please note that the databases are spread across multiple text files located in the User_Info and Books_Info folders. But the whole inital database can be viewed in the Excel file labeled "NEA_Excel" that is located in the NEA_USB
    folder. When the program is run and a new user creates an account, the Excel file would not change. If a new book is to be added to the database, it should be first added to the Excel file then into the text files in the correct
    locations. The Excel file also acts as a database backup if it is needed as such

    The database "User_Info" is used to contain all the user information (Under "User" in Excel File and the repective text files are located in the "User_Info" folder). This information is the Usernames, User Names, Encyrpted Passwords,
    User Last Seen Books, User Account Balances and the User profile picture locations ("User_UserNames.txt", "User_Names.txt","User_Passwords.txt", "User_Last_Seen.txt", "User_Account_Bal.txt", "User_Photo_Locations.txt" respectivly)

    The database "Books_Info" is used to contain all the user information (Under "Books" in Excel File and the respective text files are located in the "Books_Info" folder) The information contained is the Book Names, Book Authors, 
    Book Genres, Book Decriptions, Book Prices and Book Photo Locations ("Book_Name.txt", "Book_Author.txt", "Book_Genre.txt", "Book_Decriptions.txt","Book_Coin.txt" and "Book_Photo_Dictionary.txt" respectivly)

    The databases stated above are the base of the system, it allows the program to run as expected and work as intented.

    The "User_Photo_Locations.txt" and "Book_Photo_Locations.txt" files display the path to the "User_Images" and "Book_Images" folders respectivly. These files contain the profile pictures of the users and the cover of the books. These
    files are used so that the locations can be called from within the program and are all located in one location.
    

Imported Files used in Main Program:

    Encyrption_And_Decryption_Subroutines.py - Used to import two subroutines, Encrypt and Decrypt. These subroutines are used to decrypt and encrypt the user passwords located in the database

    Mega_Book_List_Creation.py - Used to import a subroutine called Mega_Book_List, this subroutine creates a large dictionary containing the book info (Key 1 = "Genre1","PhotoLocation1","BookName","BookAuthor","BookPrice",
    "Book_Decription")

    Mega_User_List_Creation.py - Used to import a subroutine called Mega_User_List, this subroutine creates a large dictionary containing user info (Key 1 = "UserUsername1","UserPhoto1","Password1","UserName1","UserAccountBal1",
    "LastSeen1")



Major Subroutine Names and their respective functions: (Please note all of the subroutines are located in the class Main_Program)

     Main_Interface - Used to display the homescreen, Genre buttons, Search Buttons, Logo and Sign In / Account drop down menu

     Page_Generation - Used to display books dependent on the genre or search result selected in the Main_Interface Subroutine

     Present_Book_Information - Used to display the books relevant information (Author, Title, Front Cover, Description and Price (If logged In))

     Login_Screen - Used to display the Login screen and allows the user to login to a existing account or create one

     Account_Creation - Used to create a new user account, also checks if the username input is already in the system

     User_Account_Interface - Used to display the user settings page, this page contains buttons that change the user profile picture, change the user's name or password, last seen, account balance and delete account
 
     User_Account_Bal_Interface - Displays information regarding the user's accocunt balance and displays the buttons and labels for increasing the balance of the account.
 
     User_Last_Seen_Interface - Displays the last four books the user has looked at (clicked on and presented book information)

     Search_Books - Displays the books dependent on the users input in the Search bar located at the top of the main page

     Destroy_All - A nested subroutine located in every major subroutine within the class, this "destroys" all the widgets (Buttons, Labels, entry boxes, ect) on the current page, each Destroy_All subroutine is uniquee and not ossociated
     with other Destroy_All subroutines in differnt major subroutines

     Return - A nested subroutine located in every major subroutine within the class, calls the previous major subroutine after calling the local Destroy_All subroutine. This directs the user back to the page they were last on.
